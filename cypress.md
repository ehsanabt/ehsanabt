# Learn Cypress

Cypress is a purely JavaScript-based front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It aims to address the pain points developers or QA engineers face while testing an application. Cypress is a more developer-friendly tool that uses a unique DOM manipulation technique and operates directly in the browser. Cypress also provides a unique interactive test runner in which it executes all commands.


Cypres helps QA engineers to test a software via browser and Cypress makes testing process easier. You can write some code to test and check all page items like: URL, Buttons, Text boxes, Texts and everything, you can even click on a button or URL by writing some codes to see if they work or not!
